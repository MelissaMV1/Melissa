**Project**: Placing Segregation

[Placing Segregation](https://dsps.lib.uiowa.edu/placingsegregation/about/participants/) is a project that represents segregation in Washington D.C., Nashville Tennessee, and Omaha Nebraska maps in the 1800s. The maps highlight the economic and ethnic/racial segregation during the 1800s in three major cities before the invention of the automobile. Some of the ethnic groups that are included in the project are German, Irish, and Italian. The project aims to show not only racial segregation but segregation against immigrants and native-born and wealthy elites to the working class. ![Placing Segregation Home Screen](https://melissamv1.github.io/Melissa/images/Home.jpeg.png)

	The project targets history and human geography for their humanistic claims. History is present in the project because it dates back to the 1800s during the time before automobiles so transportation and mobile were limited compared to the modern day. The project showed how segregation has been a part of United States history before the Jim Crow Laws era but it was limited to immigrants and native-born and to wealthy elite to working-class individuals. 
	The project also claims human geography for its humanistic claims. The project uses human geography by highlighting the movement created by humans in the community and shows that certain groups of individuals live in certain areas with manmade or natural landscapes that affect the factor of their livelihood in the area. For example, in the Nashville maps, the railroad track on the north side of the city divides the wealthy elite from the rest of the other residents in the North Ward. 
	
	This project does a good demonstration of engagement with the humanistic claim with the maps and with the different categories of race/ethnicity that can be included in the maps. It highlights the different areas individuals live in and how it was divided by race, social/economic, and ethnic. The project advanced knowledge about segregation because it provides a visual representation of segregation and placing different categories in the right location. The project uses data by using historic street networks and census records to match with the address information from the city directories. The directors created an easy visual for viewers to understand and to see the different locations different individuals lived. The categories made it easy to understand because by clicking on the category, it displayed the area where these individuals would live and individuals would visually see segregation. ![The map of Washington](https://melissamv1.github.io/Melissa/images/Washington.jpeg.png)

	The directors use technology to advance the visual of segregation and for individuals to have a realistic view of what part of Nashville, Washington, and Omaha segregation occurred. The layout of the project is two different maps that can be selected: Nashville, Washington, and Omaha. Once clicked on one of the maps, the map has different filter categories to select which showcase where these categories of individuals lived during that period. Some categories include colored people, Irish immigrants, German immigrants, wealthy elite, working class, and merchant class. Yet, when clicking on the maps, there is no additional information included; just the map with the categories.

	The limitation of the maps is that Washington and Omaha include the same categories as listed before but the Nashville map's limited categories are: wealthy elite, merchant class, and working class. The Nashville map gives viewers a limited understanding of racial segregation during this timeframe. It does include economic segregation but if the directors included racial segregation, the map would have been similar to the Washington and Omaha and been more comprehensive for viewers. The site only allows you to click on one of the categories instead of multiple, if the directors allow for multiple categories to display the viewers can have a clearer image of the segregation. The Nashville map is upside down which makes it difficult to read and see areas of segregation. ![The map of Nashville](https://melissamv1.github.io/Melissa/images/Nashvile.jpeg.png)
	
	The project uses a GIS system and a georeferenced to reconstruct each city's street grid. All of the addresses used in the data were geocoded with a customized address locator service. The directors mention their limitation of in Washington, there were not as many freed African Americans so there is a limitation in the data collected on that map. It also mentions that servants were also included in the data because they would live in the homes of the wealthy elite. That section is very important and the directors did an amazing job including their limitations in the data. 
	
	The directors did not include a legend about how to work the page although the website is beginner-friendly, it would be helpful to demonstrate to individuals how the website works and certain features of the project. There is an exercise tab in the project, when clicking on that page it is just a blank screen with any information. In the methods section, the directors used technological languages which were very difficult for me to understand. The use of plain language in that section would make it more accessible for people who do not have a background in technology or digital humanities. The project was very informative and engaging. It showcased how segregation was occurring in the 1800s which I did not know.
