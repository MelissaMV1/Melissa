# Summary 
[The Cuban American Dream Timeline](https://exhibits.uflib.ufl.edu/cubanamericandream/) is a project about the migration of Cubans to the United States and other countries but focuses specifically on the Cuban migration to Florida. The timeline includes important events such as the Cuban Revolution and the Fidel Castro uprising which caused thousands of Cubans to leave the island. ![The Cuban American Dream Timeline Home Page](https://melissamv1.github.io/Melissa/images/TheCubanAmericanDreamTimeline.png) 

The results of these events caused _The Mariel Backlash_, _The Balsero Crisis_, and _Wet-Foot-Dry Land_ that bought thousands of Cubans to Florida as refugees or exiles. These events and the migration moment by Cubans made the United States government pass policies and laws to help new Cuban immigrants assimilate into the United States. In the timeline,_El Dialogo_, _Federally Changes_, _Careers in Exiles_, and _Educating a Bilingual City_ are examples of policies, discussion, and social problems that the United States, Florida’s local community, and newly arrived Cubans faced during the influx in Miami-Dade county. The timeline includes present-day presidential policy changes from Eisenhower, Kennedy, Obama, and Trump which help see the different relationship with Cuba and the United States when presidential changes occur. 
# Humanistic Claim 
This project relates to history and human geography. With history, the project was created to educate people about the Cuban Dream and the migration of thousands of Cubans. It included historical events like the Cuban Revolution, the Bay of Pigs, and the Spanish-American War. The project does an excellent job with history as a humanities claims because it provided multiple historical events that contributed to the Cuban American dream and foreshadowed those events that were the cause of the migration to the United States.  
The project as a whole accounts for the humanistic claim of human geography. The project adjective is about thousands of Cuban exiles or refugees who left the island of Cuba. It includes different events and labels of exiles or refugees such as the _First Wave of Exiles_, _Second Wave of Exiles_, _Balsero Crisis_, and _Wet-Foot-Dry_Foot_ to show the massive influx of Cuban immigrants to the United States but more specifically Miami-Dade county, Florida. The project does an excellent job with the human geography claim because it provides the time period, a picture, and the number of people which help the viewer visualize how many people left the island. 
This project advanced knowledge about the Cuban migration or the Cuban American dream because individuals can see the timeline visual and understand that the influx of Cubans in the United States was not a one-event scenario but the sequence of historical events that caused thousands of Cubans to leave the island and arrive to the United States. The directors used this data by creating a timeline of events with important dates and pictures included. The website is easy-to-navigate because of the arrows. It also includes two translations for the website such as English and Spanish. The website would be more accessible if more language translations were available.  The website does not include any information on how to use the website which can be confusing for people who do not have much experience with websites or Digital Humanities projects. 
# Assessment of Technology 
The directors uses technology by providing a timeline of historical events and major moments to Cubans that caused and helped the assimilation process to the United States. The project includes pictures of people and important documents with information so the viewer can understand what is going on in the time period and why it is important to be included. The project is beginner friendly even though there is no information on how to use the website. The project includes two languages the website can be translated into English and Spanish. 
With the timeline, it uses left and right arrows to switch between the different events. With the major arrows, the left arrow is the previous event and the right is the upcoming event with the date. At the bottom of the timeline, it provides a left and right arrow with all the events with data so, it is easier to click on what event you want to see instead of clicking through all of them. ![Timeline Bunched Together](https://melissamv1.github.io/Melissa/images/Timeline.png) 
# Improvement and Critics 
Although, scrolling through the event is easier to pass events, it is difficult to click on the events because they are bunched together. In the same bottom overall timeline, there are gaps between the years, 1912-1957 which is not visually appealing. ![The Years Between 1912-1957](https://melissamv1.github.io/Melissa/images/Neocolonial.png) 
The projects include pictures in all of them except the images of “**The Second Wave of Exiles**” and “**Balsero Crisis**”. When arriving at “The Second Wave of Exiles” animation, it provides a link to a website which is multiple articles about the topic. The “Balsero Crisis” animation also provides a link to another Digital Humanity project about the crisis. ![The Second Wave of Exiles](https://melissamv1.github.io/Melissa/images/SecondWaveofExiles.png) 
Even though the project has minor errors, it is still an amazing project because it is very informative and engaging. Sliding through the different events and the pictures provides a more engaging and fun learning experience. The use of personal pictures and accounts made the project very personal and relatable to Cubans that have left Cuba or family members who left the island. The short and simple English texts make it easier to read and understand unlike how paragraphs with confusing language. 
# Impacts My Project 
The Cuban American Dream Timeline project is relatives to my grant project because they both are related to the Cuban migration. The Cuban American Dream Timeline project includes multiple historical events, important documents for their improvement of them, policies passed for the assimilation of new arrivals, and migration patterns; my pattern is more about the migration patterns of Cubans to the United States but focuses more on Flordia. This project helped me understand what historical events/information I need to include in my project. My project is different because the Timeline provides an overview of different events that caused Cubans to arrive in Miami-Dade county while my project will only focus on the migration patterns of Cuban to Florida.
