# Digital Humanities 
My definition of digital humanities is the combination of technology in humanities. The purpose of educating individuals with a modern and more accessible approach. My definition of digital in humanities did not change over time because I had a hard time trying to understand the definitions. I found it really challenging to focus on one definition and understand a specific one when there were multiple presented in class. Yet, throughout the course and after reviewing different digital humanities projects, it has helped me better understand what digital humanities is and place a definition for it. 
# Readings 
The readings were helpful to the course. Some of the readings were more helpful than others. The readings that were most helpful for me were _Jason Heppler's “What is Digital Humanities”_, _Anne Lamott’s “Shitty First Draft”_, and _Nielson Norman Group's “Texting Scanning Patterns: Eyetracking Evidence”_. These readings were short and straightforward, unlike some readings that were challenging to read along. 
One example of readings that was challenging to comprehend was  _Yvette Shen’s “Placing Graphic Design at the Intersection of Information Visualization Field”_ and _Tom Shofield, et al. “Research through design and digital humanities in practice: What, how, and who in an archive research project”_. The reason why it was difficult for me to read was the use of technology language throughout them. I understand that in digital humanities, we have to understand the digital part and have some basic knowledge of the technology being used but it was still hard for me to understand. It would be helpful if Dr. Strover explain the reading in the next class so everyone can familiarize themselves with the technology used in digital humanities and have some basic understanding of the readings. 
# Assignments 
The grant writing assignment was an assignment that I enjoyed in the course. The grant writing assignment was enjoyable and engaging. When I first heard about the assignment, I was worried that it was going to be long and time-consuming but the assignment was enjoyable and engaging. What I loved most about the assignment is that it was short and straight to the point. Dr. Strover broke down the assignment by first creating the project description and then adding an abstract. This was helpful because we were able to focus on the project description and not worry about the abstract until later classes. 
With the final grant writing assignment, Dr. Strover took the time to make edits, and comments, and meet with us about what needed to be included and taken out. I believe this was the best thing Dr, Strover would have done because some of us never wrote a grant before and were not sure what needed to be included and excluded in the final assignment. ![Melissa’s Grant Assignment](https://melissamv1.github.io/Melissa/images/Grant.png) 
Review blog two was another assignment that I enjoy very much. Since we chose what digital humanities project we wanted and it was somewhat similar to our grant ideas, it was more personal and we had more freedom. Although we could choose whatever project we wanted, Dr. Strover provided multiple websites and resources for digital humanities projects available to us. This helped students like me that did not know where to look for digital humanities projects and made it easier for us to select one provided by her. ![The Cuban American Dream Timeline Project](https://melissamv1.github.io/Melissa/images/Thecubanproject.png)
# Writer 
I think I have grown as a writer, throughout the semester Dr. Strover has pushed us to be more concise in our writing. It was difficult sometimes to be concise and have the word count such as in the grant writing assignment but Dr. Strover helped us make edits to our work and always provided comments in our assignments that were useful throughout the semester.
