??About Me

My name is Melissa and I am a student at [Christopher Newport News](www.cnu.edu). I am currently a social work major in my senior year. My pronouns are she/her. I am currently in a Digital Humanities class which will help me become a better writer and also help me market and present myself on social media professionally. Digital Humanities (DH) is an interesting course because it is the combination of humanities with technology and making it more accessible. 

I am a social work major because when I was in high school I wanted to work in the United Nations and the two majors needed for the work are social work and political science. I chose social work because I thought I would write less papers but unfortunately I have been writing multiple papers every social work class. I changed my passion for working in the United Nations my freshman year of college because I did not want more schooling so I became interested in working with veterans. I planned to do my internship in the VA field but I spoke with different people and my interest in CPS occurred. 

I plan to attend _Norfolk State University_ for graduate school for my Masters in Social Work (MSW) with a specialization of Child Welfare. After I graduate school, I hope to work in Social Services in the Child Welfare unit in Foster Care or an agency that helps teach prevention skills, independent living, and educational courses to adolescent or aging-out foster care youth . After a couple of years in the Child Welfare unit, I want to go back to go and receive my PhD in social work. 

Since I am a social work major, I have volunteered throughout my whole college career. Some places I have volunteered are Habitat for Humanity ReStore and Knights of Columbus. I am currently an intern in [York-Poquoson Department of Social Sciences] (https://www.yorkcounty.gov/159/Social-Services) in the **Child Protective Service (CPS)**. But, I am learning the umbrella of the Child Welfare system such as Foster Care, CPS, and Family Support/Prevention.

I was born in Cuba but I moved to Hampton, Virginia when I was six years old with my brother and my parents. I frequently visited Cuba when I was younger but I have not been back since I was 15 years old. I always tell people that I was raised in Hampton when asked where I am from to avoid questions about Cuba. 

One of my hobbies is going to the gym with my boyfriend. I go to the gym 5 times a week because of my internship but I usually go 6 times a week. I have two dogs, Asha and Negrin. Asha is about to be 5 months old, she is a full breed bully and Negrin is 12 years old, he is a weiner dog mixed with a terrier. My boyfriend and I plan to breed Asha when she is two years old so we can have one of her babies.
